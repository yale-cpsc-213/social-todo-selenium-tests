* Events that are over are not shown
* As a user I can visit your page for creating new events at `/events/new`

    * The hour select should be in 24-hour time format: 0-23 are selectable.
    * The month select should have integer value attributes, numbered 0-11, and refer to months by their names: January, February, etc.
    * You should only be able to schedule events in 2015 and 2016
  * If the submitted form is valid, I am redirected to the detail page for that new event.
    This redirect is accomplished using a ["302" HTTP response](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_302).
